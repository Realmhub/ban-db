# Realm Hub Community Banlist

This repository hosts the official banlist for the Realm Hub community. We maintain this list to keep our Minecraft Bedrock servers safe, fair, and fun for every player.

## Our Commitment to Transparency

We believe that a fair community requires open information. Suspensions and bans are never private or arbitrary. By keeping this list on GitHub, we ensure that every action is documented and visible to the public.

* **Public Records:** Every ban includes the player's Gamertag and the specific reason for the removal.
* **Audit Trail:** The GitHub commit history shows exactly when a name was added or modified.
* **Clear Policies:** We list the rules clearly so players know exactly what behavior leads to a ban.

## Ban Categories

| Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cheating** | Using external hacks like horion, speed hacks. |
| **Exploiting** | Using game-breaking bugs to gain an unfair advantage. |

## How to Appeal

Mistakes can happen. If you believe your Gamertag is on this list in error, you can submit an appeal through our official Discord ticket system. Our moderation team reviews appeals weekly. We look at the original evidence and your statement to make a final decision.
